It would be helpful if readme file or requirements file had the package installation details before running the code. And adding a few instructions on how to run the code would be great.
The code is modular. Adding comments about the function of a particular code block would be useful (to someone like me who has trouble understanding the front-end code) because then I would know where to make changes inorder to integrate my code .
